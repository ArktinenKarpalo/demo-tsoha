	<p>This application allows the user to upload image files, tag them and filter them with the given tags.</p>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>When using search, separate tags by space, write - in front of tag to exclude the tag.</p>
	<p>Example: searching with: tag1 tag2 -tag3, displays results that have tag1 and tag2, but not tag3.
	<p>Currently supports only common image file formats (png, jpg), but support for other files could be added by using pre-determined thumbnails/generated previews.</p>
